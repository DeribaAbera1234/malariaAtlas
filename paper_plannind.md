malariaAtlas: an R interface to open-access global malariometric data to
support spatial epidemiological analysis

**Things to include somewhere: **

-   reference to the new web-based tools

-   

**Background: **

-   Importance of the data -- current uses in global decision-making and

-   Overview/update of the data estate

-   Purpose of the package

-   Overview of example analyses and their utility

**Package Overview: **

Exploring available data:

-   listAll -- pr points; rasters; shapefiles

Downloading & visualising Data:

-   getPR & autoplot

-   getRaster & autoplot

-   getShp

> \- N.B. by country; geographic bounding box; shapefile

Manipulating Data:

-   extract raster values for a set of coordinates

-   calculate zonal statistics from a raster for a given administrative
    unit/shapefile/bounding box

**Example Analyses: **

1\. Estimated spatial distribution of PR in a country

2\. Zoon-based analysis

**Discussion & Conclusions: **
